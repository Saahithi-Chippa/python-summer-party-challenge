# Python Summer Party üêçüéâ  

This repository contains my completed notebooks from **Interview Master's Python Summer Party Challenge (Summer 2025)**.  
The challenge consisted of a series of daily Python problems focused on **data manipulation, analysis, and problem-solving** using `pandas` and `numpy`.  

The notebooks demonstrate my ability to:
- Write clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code
- Perform advanced data wrangling and transformations with **pandas**
- Apply **numpy** for optimized numerical computations
- Translate problem statements into structured analytical solutions
- Communicate solutions clearly through code and markdown explanations


## üìÇ Repository Structure  

- `day-01.ipynb`, `day-02.ipynb`, ... in `Solutions` folder: Daily challenge notebooks  
- Each notebook includes:
  - Problem description
  - My solution approach
  - Final implementation and validation


## How to use

1. Create and activate a Python environment (venv or conda).
2. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install jupyterlab pandas numpy
   
3. Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook and open any `day-XX.ipynb` file.
